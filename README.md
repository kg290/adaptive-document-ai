# Concise Adaptive Document Assistant v9.3

A FastAPI-based document analysis system that uses adaptive AI models to provide accurate, concise answers from PDF documents. Features smart complexity detection, dynamic keyword extraction, and multi-strategy document retrieval.

## 🚀 Features

- **Adaptive AI Processing**: Automatically adjusts response timing based on query complexity
- **Dynamic Keyword Extraction**: Uses YAKE algorithm for intelligent document analysis
- **Multi-Strategy Search**: Advanced chunk scoring with metadata-weighted reranking
- **Dual Model System**: Primary Llama-4-Scout with Kimi-K2 fallback
- **PDF Processing**: Direct PDF URL ingestion and text extraction
- **Concise Responses**: Professional, clean formatting (30-40 words typically)
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Adaptive key pool management with 6 API keys
- **Performance Optimized**: ~1s for simple queries, extends only when needed

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd document-assistant
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# Optional: Add any additional configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The system comes pre-configured with:
- **6 Groq API keys** (built-in)
- **Primary Model**: meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct (30K TPM)
- **Fallback Model**: moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct (10K TPM)
- **Adaptive concurrency**: 2-3 concurrent requests based on complexity

## 🚦 Usage

### Start the Server
```bash
python legal_document_analyser.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Health Check
```bash
GET /
```

#### 2. Pool Status
```bash
GET /pool-status
```

#### 3. Process Documents (Main Endpoint)
```bash
POST /api/v1/hackrx/run
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "documents": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
  "questions": [
    "What is the grace period for premium payments?",
    "What are the maternity benefits covered?",
    "Define the term 'Hospital' as mentioned in the policy?"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answers": [
    "Grace period is thirty (30) days from the due date for premium payment, subject to policy terms.",
    "Maternity expenses covered after 9 months waiting period, limited to sum insured.",
    "Hospital means any institution with at least 10 beds for indoor treatment under qualified medical supervision."
  ]
}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Document Processing
- Downloads PDF from provided URL
- Extracts text using PyMuPDF
- Creates comprehensive chunks with metadata scoring

### 2. Query Analysis
- **Complexity Detection**: Analyzes query for complexity indicators
- **Dynamic Keywords**: Uses YAKE to extract relevant terms
- **Adaptive Context**: Adjusts chunk count (7-8) based on complexity

### 3. AI Processing
- **Primary**: Llama-4-Scout for initial analysis
- **Fallback**: Kimi-K2 for complex queries or low confidence
- **Smart Triggers**: Automatic fallback based on answer quality

### 4. Response Optimization
- Clean formatting (removes \\n characters)
- Professional tone
- Essential information preservation
- 30-40 word target length

## 🎯 Query Complexity Examples

### Simple Queries (⚡)
- "What is the waiting period?"
- "Is maternity covered?"
- "What is the room rent limit?"

### Complex Queries (🔍)
- "What are all the exclusions and their conditions?"
- "Define comprehensive coverage including all sub-limits?"
- "Explain the complete claim process with requirements?"

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Simple Queries**: ~1.0s average response time
- **Complex Queries**: ~2.5s average response time
- **Success Rate**: >95% with dual model system
- **Concurrency**: 2-3 requests (adaptive based on complexity)
- **Rate Limits**: 30K TPM primary, 10K TPM fallback

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Modify Complexity Detection
Edit `analyze_query_complexity()` function to add custom indicators:

```python
complexity_indicators = {
    'your_category': ['custom', 'keywords', 'here']
}
```

### Adjust Response Length
Modify prompts to change target word count:

```python
# In ADAPTIVE_PRIMARY_PROMPT
"Keep answers concise (X–Y words)"
```

### Custom Chunking
Modify `comprehensive_document_chunking()` for domain-specific patterns:

```python
critical_patterns = [
    r'your_custom_pattern',
    # Add patterns specific to your document type
]
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Pool Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/pool-status
```

**Response includes:**
- Active/total keys
- Success rate
- Average response time
- Model usage statistics
- Complex queries handled

### Logs
The system provides detailed logging:
- Query complexity analysis
- Model selection decisions
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic key rotation and cooling
- **Fallback System**: Secondary model for failed requests
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns best available answer

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Key Components

1. **AdaptiveKeyPool**: Manages 6 API keys with rate limiting
2. **AdaptiveRetriever**: Smart document chunking and retrieval
3. **Dynamic Keyword Extraction**: YAKE-based relevance scoring
4. **Multi-Strategy Search**: Combines exact matching, semantic similarity, and metadata scoring

### Architecture
```
PDF URL → Text Extraction → Dynamic Chunking → Keyword Analysis
                                    ↓
Query → Complexity Analysis → Context Retrieval → AI Processing → Clean Response
```
